# Security

We appreciate all efforts to discover and responsibly disclose security
vulnerabilities. If you think you found a security issue in a Fermyon project or with the Fermyon Cloud,
please send an email to security@fermyon.com.

The above also includes reporting any concerns with content hosted on The Fermyon Cloud.

If possible, please include the following information:

- the type of the issue, vulnerability or incident you want to report
- steps to reproduce, proof of concept, or a minimal verifiable example
  demonstrating the issue or vulnerability
- versions (or commit SHAs) for the tools used, and any special configuration
- impact of the issue

> **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues,
> discussions, or pull requests.**

After an initial reply to your report, our team will update you with the
progress towards remediating the issue, and with any potential next steps.

Thank you for helping us keep our projects and services secure and inclusive for everyone!
